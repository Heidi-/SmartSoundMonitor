App Overview
------------
A simple Node.js application that blinks the onboard LED (a GPIO output),
on select Intel IoT development boards, and displays the result of that write
on the console log.

The app initializes a single pin to digital output mode, so it can be written;
writes that digital output at a regular basis; and prints the result of each
write to the console. The specific pin that is written is configured in
`cfg-app-platform.js` and can be identified by looking for lines similar to the
following line of code, in the `cfg.init` method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    io = opt.altPin ? io : 100 ;            // use alternate pin?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the example shown above, LED "pin 100" will be used to flash the LED.

**IMPORTANT:** the LED pin that is configured by the sample is a function of the
detected board. You **must** inspect the code to determine which LEd pin is being
configured for use on your board!!

Some boards have multiple LEDs that can be written to ("flashed" or "blinked").
The `cfg-app-platform.js` module has been designed so you can override the pin
that is used, by passing it an alternate pin during the init call (see the module
documentation). Or, you can simply modify the code to change the default value.

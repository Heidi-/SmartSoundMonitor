IntelÂ® XDK IoT * Personal Sound/Noise Exposure Monitor
=============================================
See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for license terms and conditions.

App Overview
------------
This is a personal noise exposure monitor designed for the Women Who Code IoT Sustainable Cities Hackathon, sponsored by Intel.

Internationally, both cities and urban workplaces are getting louder and louder. Prolonged exposure to noise can have negative effects on health and productivity. The monitor provides instantaneous feedback (LEDS alert the user to sounds over 120dB, OSHA's recommended sound level). The monitor also tracks the cummulative amount of noise the user is exposed to over a 24 hour period, and alerts the user when they've hit above the WHO's recommend noise exposure for the day.

The monitor comes equipped with vibration and a buzzer for the visually impaired, and pulls data from Strava or Fitbit to measure heart rate and graph it against noise exposure.

Hardware Requirements
------------
* Grove Starter Kit Plus containing:
* Intel Edison platform with an Arduino breakout board
* Grove Sound Sensor
* Grove red, green and blue LEDs
* Grove Rotation Motor

Software Requirements
------------
* Intel System Studio IoT Edition
* Intel XDK
* Node.JS library


Getting Started
------------
For help getting started developing applications with the
Intel XDK, please start with
[the Intel XDK documentation](https://software.intel.com/en-us/xdk/docs).

The app initializes a single pin to digital output mode, so it can be written;
writes that digital output at a regular basis; and prints the result of each
write to the console. The specific pin that is written is configured in
`cfg-app-platform.js` and can be identified by looking for lines similar to the
following line of code, in the `cfg.init` method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    io = opt.altPin ? io : 100 ;            // use alternate pin?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the example shown above, LED "pin 100" will be used to flash the LED.

**IMPORTANT:** the LED pin that is configured by the sample is a function of the
detected board. You **must** inspect the code to determine which LEd pin is being
configured for use on your board!!

Some boards have multiple LEDs that can be written to ("flashed" or "blinked").
The `cfg-app-platform.js` module has been designed so you can override the pin
that is used, by passing it an alternate pin during the init call (see the module
documentation). Or, you can simply modify the code to change the default value.
